Data File explained: As students you probably have to rate your lecturers at the end of the course. There will be some lecturers you like and others that you hate. There is some evidence that students tend to pick courses of lecturers whom they perceive to be enthusiastic and good communicators. In a fascinating study, Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic and his colleagues (Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, Christopher, Garwood, & Martin, 2008) tested a slightly different hypothesis, which was that students tend to like lecturers who are like (similar to) themselves. 
First of all, the authors measured students’ own personalities using a very well-established measure (the NEOAC) which gives rise to scores on five fundamental personality traits: Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness to experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. 
They also asked students to rate how much they wanted to see these traits in a lecturer from −5 (they don’t want this characteristic at all) through 0 (the characteristic is not important) to +5 (I really want this characteristic in my lecturer). 
As such, the authors had a measure of how much a student had each of the five core personality characteristics, but also a measure of how much they wanted to see those same characteristics in their lecturer. 
In doing so, Tomas and his colleagues could test whether, for instance, extroverted students want extrovert lecturers.
