In general, students tended to prefer lecturers who were high on Conscientiousness and Openness toExperience. More specific associations indicated that open students tended to prefer open lectur-ers, whilst agreeable students tended to prefer agreeable lecturers.

 Table 1
 shows the mean ratings and standard deviations for each of the 30 facets of the NEO-PI-R as used by students to rate the preferred personality characteristics of their lecturers. Over-all, the Conscientiousness facets all received positive evaluations (particularly C1 and C2), whileall the Neuroticism facets received strong negative evaluations. Two Extraversion (E1, E6), threeOpenness (O3, O4, O5), and one Agreeableness (A3) facet, received positive ratings, but partic-ipants seemed reasonably indifferent to many other facets from these three traits (e.g. E4, O1, O6,A4, A5). Thus, students wanted their lecturers to be stable, conscientious, extraverted, agreeable,and open (in that order).

 Bivariate correlations for the target variables. As seen, female studentstended to prefer emotionally stable and conscientious lecturers, whilst younger students weremore likely to prefer agreeable lecturers.
 
 1. Students’ Neuroticism was significantly positively correlated with preference for agreeable lecturers.
 
 2. Students’ Extraversion correlated negatively with preference for neurotic,and positively with preference for extraverted lecturers. 
  
3. Open students tended to dislike both neurotic and agreeable lecturers, preferring those high on Openness.

4. Agreeableness in students correlated positively with preference for open, agreeable, and consci-entious lecturers, whereas conscientious students disliked neurotic, but liked extraverted and conscientious lecturers.

5. Thus, with the exception of Neuroticism, each of the Big Five traitsreflected congruency between students’ own and lecturers’ preferred personality, supporting our first hypothesis
